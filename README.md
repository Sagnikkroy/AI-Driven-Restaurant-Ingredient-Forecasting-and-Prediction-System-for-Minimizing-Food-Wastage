AI-Driven Restaurant Ingredient Forecasting and Prediction System for Minimizing Food Wastage

The food industry, particularly restaurants, faces significant challenges in managing ingredient inventory efficiently. One of the most pressing issues is food wastage, which leads to financial losses and negative environmental impacts. Poor demand forecasting, lack of real-time tracking, and inefficient supply chain management contribute to excessive food spoilage and wastage.
To address this, the AI-Driven Restaurant Ingredient Forecasting and Prediction System for Minimizing Food Wastage leverages machine learning (ML) and predictive analytics to accurately estimate ingredient requirements. This ensures that restaurants stock only what is needed, optimizing inventory and reducing waste.
How This System Works
(a) Data Collection & Input Sources
The system collects historical and real-time data from:
1.	Customer Orders – What dishes were ordered and how frequently.
2.	Ingredient Usage – What ingredients were used and their consumption rate.
3.	Public Holidays & Festivals – To predict customer footfall.
4.	Seasonal Trends – Variation in demand due to weather conditions.
5.	Supplier Data – Lead time, availability, and pricing trends.
(b) Machine Learning-Based Forecasting
The system applies AI and predictive analytics to:
•	Identify patterns in customer demand over time.
•	Analyze how festivals, weekends, and seasonal factors impact ingredient needs.
•	Forecast monthly ingredient requirements using advanced ML models such as time-series forecasting (ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet, etc.).
(c) Real-Time Inventory Optimization
•	The system integrates with restaurant inventory databases to track ingredient stock levels.
•	It suggests reordering strategies, ensuring that stock is maintained at an optimal level.
•	Alerts are generated for perishable ingredients that need urgent usage.
(d) Minimizing Wastage and Cost Reduction
•	The system recommends portion sizes and efficient menu planning.
•	It ensures optimal purchasing decisions, reducing excess inventory.
•	AI can provide alternative ingredient suggestions in case of shortages.
(e) Dynamic Supplier Coordination
•	Automated ordering helps streamline supplier coordination.
•	The system suggests the best time to restock ingredients based on price and demand trends.
•	Reduces last-minute emergency purchases, which are often more expensive.
